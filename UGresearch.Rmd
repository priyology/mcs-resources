## About the research opportunities database
* There is a lot of great information in the [READ ME tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MHCjRO2b5UuEVCsVbjdYFLEaBaaQWgfGkgpIbLKZCGA/edit#gid=1423802416) of the database about **expectations** for research opportunities, **skills** you gain from participating in research experiences (even if research doesn't end up being your dream job!), and **how to apply** for such positions. 

## General advice about undergraduate research experiences

## Compensation for research

You will notice that some of the positions in the database will be able to pay you, but many of the opportunities you come across will also be volunteer positions that may compensate you with academic units and/or transcript notation. You can learn more about enrolling in academic units via the [Internship & Career Center](https://icc.ucdavis.edu/find/internships/academic-credit) and applying to your own funding for undergrad research via the [Undergraduate Research Center](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/programs).

So here are few things you can expect ... 

* Short-term volunteer positions (1-2 days, weeks) may not necessarily come with any compensation. However, they are a great way to figure out if you like a specific field or discipline, want to commit to a project for longer than just 1-2 meetings, and make a connection with someone who could **be a reference** for a future position.
  + These positions can also be great ways to accumulate experience around a busy class or work schedule! 
* For, longer-term volunteer positions (1+ months), you should consider getting research or internship units and/or transcript notation. Ask your PI how this works if you would like to find out more and what might best fit the research experience you are interested in.
  + In some cases, enrolling in Research/Internship units can serve as a class and help meet the requirements of being a "full-time" student
* For paid positions, you will receive monetary compensation. And sometimes, you *may* also receive units, but this will vary on a case-by-case basis.


### Approaching a mentor about compensation


So, let's say you're super jazzed about a position, but you're nervous about talking to you research mentor about compensation. Or, maybe you've been in a volunteer position for awhile, but you'd like to see if you can stay on and make money. Regardless of your reasoning, it's perfectly acceptable - and encouraged - to make sure you and your mentor are on the same page about how you're being compensation!


Here is some language you are welcome to use and modify to approach your mentor (this assumes you are communicating via e-mail, but haven't started the position yet):

Dear **[MENTOR]**,


I'm really looking forward to working with the **[RESEARCH GROUP]** for the next **[TIME YOU WILL BE WITH THEM]** working on **[PROJECT]**. I'm especially excited about **[SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO]**. Because I plan to work with the **[RESEARCH GROUP]** while also **[OTHER COMMITMENT (e.g., taking the classes I need to, holding my part-time job, picking up my kids after school, etc.]**, I'm wondering if we can work together to find ways for me to **[earn academic units] / [obtain funding]** for my work in the **[LAB/CENTER]**. 


For example, the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Center offers certain programs (see here: [https://urc.ucdavis.edu/programs](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/programs)). I've also heard that some departments offer undergraduate students work-study positions. Additionally, I can enroll in **[CLASS]** to earn **[research/internship]** units towards my degree or have this experience document on my transcript. These are just a few ideas, and I'm really interested in discussing this with you further.


Thank you for considering this request.


Best wishes,


**[YOUR NAME]**
