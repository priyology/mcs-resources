This is a resource to help you navigate experiences beyond coursework -- research, finding funding / internships / jobs, and learning about the culture of science/academia.

<br>

If you have questions about declaring your emphasis, registering for courses, studying abroad, and joining clubs, you should check out the [MCSci Orientation](https://geology.ucdavis.edu/students/undergrad/mcsci/orientation). (You'll also find advise on undergraduate research and scholarship opportunities!)

<br>

This website has been designed with Marine and Coastal Science Majors at UC Davis in mind, but has resources all marine science undergraduate students.
