<center> ## **Weekly BML Seminar Series Discussion**
</center>

### Mary and Louise Riley Seminar Series Complement

This will consist of a discussion group (limited to 30 students) based on [**BML’s seminar series**](BMLseminar.html). Before each seminar, we will discuss one of the current speakers’ papers, then watch the seminar at CMSI and submit questions as a class.
