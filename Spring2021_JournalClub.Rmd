## Course Description
The Journal Club for Bodega Marine Lab Seminar Series will consist of a discussion group (limited to 30 students) based on [**BML’s seminar series**](BMLseminar.html). Before each seminar, we will discuss one of the current speakers’ papers, then watch the seminar at CMSI and submit questions as a class.


## Key Learning Outcomes
* Develop skills in reading, interpreting and critiquing marine science journal articles 
* Improve understanding of research design, statistics, and techniques for evaluating sound science
* Practice public speaking and leading a technical discussion
* Tie a researcher’s previous work (paper) with their ongoing work (seminar)

## Grading
The class is graded as P/NP. Grades will be determined based on class participation and journal entries that must be completed PRIOR to class.

* You must attend class and engage in discussions about the papers. Thus, missing several classes will put a passing grade in jeopardy.
* Assignments will consist of journal entries for each paper. These should be completed by 10am the day of class (1 hour before class meets). Barring exceptional circumstances, late submissions will not be accepted.
* Each week, 2-3 students will co-facilitate a discussion (you are expected to split the responsibilities amongst yourselves):
  + Summarizing the paper
  + Asking / providing points of clarification
  + Facilitating the discussion
  + Summarizing the discussion

#### Criteria for a Passing Grade
Because participation is a key component of this course, the bar for a passing grade is high: 
* You must attend 9/10 classes.
* You must participate in class discussions.
* You must submit 8/9 journal entries.
* You must (co-)facilitate 6/7 discussions and submit the accompanying document.

*If you have obligations that will prevent you from attending class or submitting assignments, please let me know so that we can discuss alternative arrangements for making sure you are getting the most out of this course!*
