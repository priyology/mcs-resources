This is a professional development seminar for sophomore, junior, and first-year transfer students in the Marine and Coastal Science (MCS) major (class is capped at 30 students) that covers topics spanning how to find and read scientific papers; what academic science/research entails; building a resume and/or CV; writing grant and fellowship applications; applying for jobs, internships, and graduate school; science communication; and science ethics. By the end of this seminar, undergraduate students should have a better understanding of how to navigate the upper division portion of their undergraduate experience as well as exploring career options after completing their degrees.

### Territorial Acknowledgement
We [acknowledge](https://native-land.ca/territory-acknowledgement/) that UC Davis campus exists on land that the Patwin/Suisune People have thrived on since time immemorial. As settlers, we must recognize how we benefit from colonialism and how it is has impacted the Native Peoples whose lands we now use. It is incumbent upon us to dismantle components of colonialism to ensure a more just and equitable future for the Patwin/Suisune People.

This acknowledgement was made possible by [native-land.ca](native-land.ca). Consider using this resource to determine which Native Peoples' lands you currently occupy.

#### Grading

* The class is graded as P/NP. Grades will be determined based on class participation and short, weekly written assignments.
*	In order to participate, you need to attend class and engage in the breakout sessions. Because we only meet once a week, missing several classes will put a passing grade in jeopardy. 
*	Assignments will consist of pre-class reading and brief questionnaire and should be submitted by 12:00pm the day of class.
* Because a key goal of this course is to share and collect resources, the bar for a passing grade is high: 
  +	You must attend 7/10 classes.
  +	All assignments must be turned in.

#### Assignments

Assignments will consist of readings and a brief questionnaire that should be submitted **by 12:00pm the day of class**.

A quarter-long goal is to accumulate resources as a class that you can leave with and continue to reference as you continue throughout your careers. I will, of course, provide some of these, but I expect you to also look for resources related to the next week’s topic (this can be a book, a peer-reviewed article, a blog post, an Instagram post, a Facebook Group, a Twitter thread, an infographic, advice a professor gave you, something you learned from a lunch with a seminar speaker, etc.). 

Through this exercise, I hope you will not only improve your ability to find information you need, but to also see your classmates as resources. Science is competitive, but the people who have helped me through it most are those doing it alongside me! The link for this document that we will flesh out over the course of the quarter is located on the course website and is available [here](Fall2020_ProfDev_ResDoc.html).

#### JEDI in Marine Science
You may notice that Justice, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (JEDI) are not listed as an explicit topic in the course schedule. This is because issue pervades every aspect of our professional lives. Thus, we will be addressing these issues each week (in a segment I have cheekily named “JEDI Mind Tricks”). JEDI resources are also available [here](JEDImarsci.html).


#### Code of Conduct
*This Code of Conduct is based on one used by the [Western Society of Naturalists](https://www.wsn-online.org/code-of-conduct/).*

This course is intended to broaden our communal understanding of different aspects of academia and marine science. We are all coming into it with different lived experiences and levels of understanding about each topic. This courses is intended to foster the exchange of ideas, provide participants with an opportunity to share their experiences, to establish pathways for addiongal professional, and develop resources that will help our cohort grow as scientists. Thus, we are committed to creating an environment in which all attendees can participate without harassment, discrimination, or violence of any type.

**All students must be treated with respect, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, ethnicity, ability, religion, language, professional status, institution or age. All meeting participants including, but not limited to, members, volunteers, attendees, vendors, exhibitors, contractors, and guests are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct.**

This Code of Conduct applies to all activities related to this class (in-person / virtual meetings, email exchanges, and chatroom discussions).

*Expected behavior includes (but is not limited to):*

* Treating all participants and meeting facilities with respect and consideration.
* Communicating openly with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.
* Avoiding personal attacks directed toward others.
* Complying with [UC Davis' Principles of Community](https://diversity.ucdavis.edu/principles-community).
* Abiding by principles of academic integrity and ethical professional conduct.

Harassment or discrimination by or of any meeting participant or of any type will not be tolerated.

*Unacceptable behavior includes (but is not limited to):*

* Behavior that implies or indicates that someone does not belong in this class based on any personal characteristic or identity.
