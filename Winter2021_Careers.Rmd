## Course Description
This is a career exploration seminar for juniors, seniors and transfer students in the marine sciences. Each class consists of a casual conversation with guest speakers, who span different marine science career paths at different stages, but there will be an emphasis on speakers with work experience after earning a B.A. / B.S. After each conversation, students will discuss and reflect upon what they gain from each conversation.

## Key Learning Outcomes
* Meet marine scientists in a wide variety of careers
* Increase your network of marine scientists
* Have examples of how to secure a “real job” after finishing your undergraduate degree
* Explore/Discover why certain positions may or may not be a good fit 
* **Have a better understanding of what it takes to get a marine science job**

## Grading

* The class is graded as P/NP. Grades will be determined based on class participation and guided reflections at the end of each class. 
  +	To participate, you need to attend class and engage in the conversations with guest speakers and each other. **We will be doing the bulk of our work in class**, so missing several classes will put a passing grade in jeopardy. 
  + Assignments will consist of a guided reflection during each class. These should be submitted **by the END of each class**.

* Because participation is a key component of this course, the bar for a passing grade is high: 
  + You must attend 9/10 classes.
  + You must submit 9/10 guided reflections.

*If you have obligations that will prevent you from attending 9/10 classes, please let me know so that we can discuss alternative arrangements for making sure you are getting the most out of this course!*

*The instructor reserves the right to change details of the above course plans to ensure the best possible learning environment.*
